Headliner will help you easily promote your posts to new people
on Facebook and Twitter.  Reach new audiences for free.

== Description ==

Headliner.fm is a messaging platform that allows like minded people to
recommend each other in their status updates on Facebook, Twitter, and
other social networks. Get recommended and reach new audiences through
people they already like and follow.

Every recommendation is created by each user, so you can control exactly what you want to say and direct traffic to the precise link of your choice. Every request is approved by each member of our community receiving the request, so you never have to worry about unwanted content posting on your social networks. There is no pressure to promote any content that you don’t feel is a good fit for your audience, and there are no penalties for being selective. In fact, we encourage people to be discreet in their choices.

Speaking of choices, Headliner offers an array of targeting options that you can customize based on your needs. You can select genres, industries, social networks, locations, and schedules to get the best reach out of your recommendations.

= What is Promote This

Promote This is a product of Headliner.fm that allows you to easily create
Headliner promotions from your WordPress site. Using the Promote This button, you can generate promotion requests without leaving your blog.

Be sure to include your name and a link to your content so people know
it's you and where they can find you. Try to be catchy with your message so that stands out and gets people’s attention. We will shorten the link automatically for you, and warn you if your message is over the character limit before you start your promotion.

= How much does it cost to use Headliner.fm?

Headliner.fm is a free service. We use a virtual currency called Karma Cash to help bands, products, artisans, and others “pay” for their posts. Karma Cash is calculated based on how fans, followers, and friends you have on each social network that you connected to Headliner.fm. We also give users bonuses for connecting their networks, and you earn Karma Cash every time you promote someone else.

Most of our members choose the free basic experience, but if you want to subscribe and upgrade your account, you will also get bonus Karma Cash every month that your paid subscription renews successfully. Paid subscribers can also run more than one promotion at the same time and get more detailed analytics so they can further optimize their marketing.
